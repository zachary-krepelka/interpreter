# Lisp Interpreter Written in Java

This was my data-structures project from a year ago.  I'm refactoring it and
writing documentation.  It's still a work in progress.

# To start a REPL

`java -jar Interpreter.jar [OPTIONS]`

# To execute a file

`java -jar Interpreter.jar [FILE] [OPTIONS]`

# Options

| flag        | functionality                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| `--color`   | ANSI Escape Sequences        |
| `--log`     | Prints diagnostic info       |
| `--recover` | Tries to recover from errors |
